I was born and raised in Indonesia. I have tried various activities, and ended up making a small project for myself. I am currently attending my senior year of high school (graduation 2022) at Stony Brook School. I tend to be interested in the processes of making a product such as music, buildings, video games, companies, or food. I also enjoy cooking. Cooking relaxes me, but also gives me a sense of excitement.\r\n \r\n# Currently\r\n \r\nAt Stony Brook School, my day starts at 6:30am. The academic day goes from 8am - 3:15pm, and after that, there are sports from 4pm - 5:30pm/6pm (depending on the sport). After sports, day-students leave campus and boarding students have dinner from 6pm - 7pm. Study hall takes place from 7:30pm - 9:15pm. As for the classes I am currently taking, I am challenging myself in AP Stats, AP Computer Science, AP US History, AP English Literature, and Linear Algebra. During the weekend, I spend much of my time exploring my intellectual and personal curiosities.\r\n\r\n# Some history\r\n \r\n- The first ten years of my life, I lived in Indonesia. I lived in an apartment that included a big park. I not only made friends with other kids living in my apartment but also with the staff/security guards.\r\n \r\n- Every day, after school, I would call my friends to meet at the park typically at 4pm and play until 6pm. I would usually manage to gather around eight to nine people, and depending on those who came, we would either play soccer or hide and seek tag.\r\n \r\n- I broke my right arm at the age of 4. I learned to write with my left from this incident.\r\n \r\n- I played the piano twice a week and performed in a group playing Mamma Mia.\r\n \r\n- At the age of 10, I left to study in the US.\r\n \r\n- I moved from rented house to rented house for my first year in the US.\r\n \r\n- My first year of school in the US was at St. Bartholomew School.\r\n \r\n- At the age of 11, I entered Rumsey Hall as a 6th grader. \r\n \r\n- I played lacrosse for the very first time in 6th grade.\r\n \r\n- I was the only other male boarder, apart from my roommate, who was in 6th grade.\r\n \r\n- I found interest in hand drawing, and drew various things from story characters to Pok\xe9mon.\r\n \r\n- In 7th grade, I made new friends and found my place.\r\n \r\n- In 8th grade, I learned to ski for the first time.\r\n \r\n- In 9th grade, I learned to snowboard, which I preferred more.\r\n \r\n- The summer I turned 14, I went surfing for the first time.\r\n \r\n- The following year, I was re-inspired to play music, so I picked up the guitar.\r\n \r\n- The same year, I began to explore my curiosities and interest, landing me at music composition.\r\n \r\n- At the age of 15, I began fiddling with a music compiling app, Fruity Loop. I watched YouTube tutorials for the most part.\r\n \r\n- At the age of 16, still exploring my curiosities, I found programming/coding.\r\n \r\n- I spent time watching YouTube videos as well as things I find on \u201cstack overflow\u201d to learn the basics -- I noticed that knowing some basics in programming could benefit in the gaming realm.\r\n \r\n- I would question how phones are programmed or how autonomous a code can be.\r\n \r\n- At the age of 17, I was reminded of the existence of AI and found interest in this subject.\r\n \r\n- During the summer I turned 18, I was selected for a program \u201cDesign the Future\u201d and made an app, 2WDA, that helped wheelchair users find wheelchair accessible bathrooms. I also became a computational intern at Zenerate.\r\n \r\n- At Zenerate, I collaborated with a computational designer on a .csv file of lots in the US. I was tasked to create a prorgam that identifies the shape of the lots and label the edges as front, rear, or side.\r\n \r\n \r\n# Hobbies\r\n\r\n- Snowboarding\r\n \r\n- Trying new food\r\n \r\n- Playing guitar\r\n \r\n- Playing soccer\r\n \r\n- Cooking\r\n \r\n- Fishing\r\n \r\n- 3D modeling\r\n \r\n- Listening to music (Lo-Fi)\r\n \r\n- Learning / Experiencing new things\r\n",h=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,m=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(t.jsx)(o.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(t.jsx)(d.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Robin Young",children:Object(t.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(t.jsx)("header",{children:Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(t.jsx)(o.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(t.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),Object(t.jsx)(s.a,{source:l,renderers:{Link:m},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
