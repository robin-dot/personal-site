If I was lucky, I’d see a rat dashing across the floor. I found comfort in imagining what that room could have been, and so in high school I re-designed my dorm’s interior to feel more like home and a place of comfort',

    desc: 'This cookie package was an assignment from a graphic design class. The outcome of this design, once folded, is supposed to resemble an oven. No one really thinks about how packages are made, and it is unusual to see someone admire the package more than the object inside the package. But through my journey with this assignment, I have learned the complex route to what it takes for a package design to be decided. Noticing my lack of foresight, I started to pay attention to topics/subjects that seemed innate for us to assume and question why or what made us innate to it.',

    desc: 'I got interested in the process by which a magazine is made. I asked a faculty member who was in charge of the yearbook photos about how he makes the yearbook. He advised me to use Adobe Indesign, and gave me a quick tutorial of how he does a layout. I went back to my room and tried to make my own yearbook. I would pick a random face I find on the internet and play around with it. I found that stretching the image horizontally would give me a funny face to look at for a good amount of time. After playing around with the InDesign feature, I jumped into real magazines and watched various YouTube videos: “how to make magazine InDesign”. From there I stumbled on videos that would cover the process of publishing magazines. ',

    desc: 'I started learning to play the guitar a year before social distancing. I was always interested in music, and figured that guitars are the easiest to learn and most portable to bring on planes. As per usual, I used YouTube’s full capability to learn how to play the guitar. I didn’t particularly learn the basics of Music or go through the AP music theory course. I namely explored my music taste and would practice playing by looking up “guitar tabs”. Eventually I started to get more and more used to seeing how chords line up and began making my own little remix. My personal music taste lies somewhere between Lo-Fi, Hip-Hop, and a bit of EDM. I’ve grown to see the charm in various kinds of music, from classical, with Beethoven or Mozart, to rap, with Shmurda or Dababy',
