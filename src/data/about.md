# Intro
 
Hello, my name is Robin Young. I was born and raised in Indonesia. I have tried various activities, and ended up making a small project for myself. I am currently attending my senior year of high school (graduation 2022) at Stony Brook School. I tend to be interested in the processes of making a product such as music, buildings, video games, companies, or food. I also enjoy cooking. Cooking relaxes me, but also gives me a sense of excitement.
 
# Currently
 
At Stony Brook School, my day starts at 6:30am. The academic day goes from 8am - 3:15pm, and after that, there are sports from 4pm - 5:30pm/6pm (depending on the sport). After sports, day-students leave campus and boarding students have dinner from 6pm - 7pm. Study hall takes place from 7:30pm - 9:15pm. As for the classes I am currently taking, I am challenging myself in AP Stats, AP Computer Science, AP US History, AP English Literature, and Linear Algebra. During the weekend, I spend much of my time exploring my intellectual and personal curiosities. 

# Some history
 
- The first ten years of my life, I lived in Indonesia. I lived in an apartment that included a big park. I not only made friends with other kids living in my apartment but also with the staff/security guards.
 
- Every day, after school, I would call my friends to meet at the park typically at 4pm and play until 6pm. I would usually manage to gather around eight to nine people, and depending on those who came, we would either play soccer or hide and seek tag.
 
- I broke my right arm at the age of 4. I learned to write with my left from this incident.
 
- I played the piano twice a week and performed in a group playing Mamma Mia.
 
- At the age of 10, I left to study in the US.
 
- I moved from rented house to rented house for my first year in the US.
 
- My first year of school in the US was at St. Bartholomew School.
 
- At the age of 11, I entered Rumsey Hall as a 6th grader. 
 
- I played lacrosse for the very first time in 6th grade.
 
- I was the only other male boarder, apart from my roommate, who was in 6th grade.
 
- I found interest in hand drawing, and drew various things from story characters to Pokémon.
 
- In 7th grade, I made new friends and found my place.
 
- In 8th grade, I learned to ski for the first time.
 
- In 9th grade, I learned to snowboard, which I preferred more.
 
- The summer I turned 14, I went surfing for the first time.
 
- The following year, I was re-inspired to play music, so I picked up the guitar.
 
- The same year, I began to explore my curiosities and interest, landing me at music composition.
 
- At the age of 15, I began fiddling with a music compiling app, Fruity Loop. I watched YouTube tutorials for the most part.
 
- At the age of 16, still exploring my curiosities, I found programming/coding.
 
- I spent time watching YouTube videos as well as things I find on “stack overflow” to learn the basics -- I noticed that knowing some basics in programming could benefit in the gaming realm.
 
- I would question how phones are programmed or how autonomous a code can be.
 
- At the age of 17, I was reminded of the existence of AI and found interest in this subject.
 
- During the summer I turned 18, I was selected for a program “Design the Future” and made an app, 2WDA, that helped wheelchair users find wheelchair accessible bathrooms. I also became a computational intern at Zenerate.
 
- At Zenerate, I collaborated with a computational designer on a .csv file of lots in the US. I was tasked to create a prorgam that identifies the shape of the lots and label the edges as front, rear, or side.
